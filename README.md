SOONâ„¢

## Dev Download

You can also head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/PirateNetwork/SevenSeasAndroid/releases) to download an APK.

### Run SevenSeas

In order to let your Android phone connect to your desktop, you need to run the deskop [SevenSeas](https://github.com/PirateNetwork/SevenSeas), and sync fully.

Grab yourself a coffee or a tea - it will take a few minutes if you're syncing from scratch.

After your node is synced, go to `Apps -> Connect Mobile App` to view the connection QR Code, which you can scan from the Android App.

### Install the Android APK directly

If you're installing the APK directly, you'll need to allow `Install from untrusted sources` on your Android phone.

### Bugs???

You can file issues in the [issues tab](https://github.com/PirateNetwork/SevenSeasAndroid/issues).


### Compiling from source

On OS X:

    brew doctor
    brew install ant
    brew install maven
    brew install gradle
    brew cask install android-sdk
    brew cask install android-ndk

    touch ~/.android/repositories.cfg
    sdkmanager --update
    sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-28"


## Release Build Process

The first time you create a release build you'll need to create two files. The release keystore is used for app signing and a properties file is used to store sensitive information about the keystore. These files should not be committed to git. Once you have both of these files you can create a release build for the Google Play Store.

### Creating a release keystore
* With Android Studio IDE open, on the system bar click Build -> Generate Signed Bundle/APK
* Select the APK option instead of the Bundle option
* On the next screen select app as the module and click "Create new"
* Set the Key Store Name to seven_seas_keystore.jks and the path to that of the project, create a password for the keystore path, a Key alias, and a key password. The store password and key password should be the same. Fill out some basic organization information and click Ok.
* On the next screen make sure the build variant "release" is selected and click Finish.

### Creating a properties file
Within the projects main directory create a file secrets.properties The contents of the file are below and filled in with the release keystore alias, key password, and store password from when you created the release keystore.

```
store_file_location=../seven_seas_keystore.jks
key_alias=<alias>
key_password=<key_password>
store_password=<store_password>
```

### Building a release APK

Before creating each build you should increment the version code & version name in the build.gradle file. These must be incremented for each release otherwise the Play Store will reject the build.

To create a release build navigate to the project directory in terminal and run

`./gradlew clean assembleRelease`

This will produce an apk file in the following directory.
SevenSeasAndroid/app/build/output/apk/release/app-release.apk

This build can be directly uploaded to Google Play.
